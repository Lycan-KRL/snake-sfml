# snake-sfml
This is a simple Snake clone using SFML and C++. This is my first project learning the integration of code and GUI's.

# Learning some SFML
After taking a few CS classes, I wanted to take my skills beyond terminal interaction and came across the SFML2 library. This project is my first attempt at recreating Snake, using header/implementation files, and using a multimedia library.

I'm happy with the results, but the game still needs a few things.

# Pending updates
Some things I'd like to implement to polish the program up a bit:
- A simple menu ( working with the mouse )
- Pausing
- Correcting the apple's flickering when updating the window

# Tools used
- SFML2 ( 32 - bit ) for Mingw
- VS Code
- Terminal
