# snake-sfml
This is a simple Snake clone using SFML and C++. This is my first project learning the integration of code and GUI's.

## Learning some SFML
After taking a few CS classes, I wanted to take my skills beyond terminal interaction and came across the SFML2 library. This project is my first attempt at recreating Snake, using header/implementation files, and using a multimedia library. I created the images used.

I'm happy with the results, but the game still needs a few things.

## Pending updates
Some things I'd like to implement to polish the program up a bit:
- [ ] A simple menu ( working with the mouse )
- [ ] Proper end screen
- [ ] Pausing
- [ ] Correcting the apple's flickering when updating the window

## Controls
Movements relies on arrow keys only. <br>
There are no walls, the snake loops around. <br>
Quit by pressing 'Q' or clicking the exit icon. <br>
If you lose the game, the window terminates immediately. <br>

## Tools used
- SFML2.5.1 ( 32 - bit ) for Mingw
- VS Code
- Terminal
